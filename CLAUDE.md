## Claude Code-specific notes

- **Slash commands:** `/check` — build + vet + gofumpt + race tests (lint is the commit hook's job).
- Workflow (worktrees, branches, commits) follows `~/Developer/github.com/blairham/AGENTS.md`.
- Run `make generate` after any change under `apis/` — the build fails without
  the deepcopy functions, and the CRD manifests drift silently.
- Integration tests need Docker: `make test-integration` starts and reuses a
  `kafkatest` container on ports 19092/19093. `make kafka-down` stops it — do
  not leave it running.
